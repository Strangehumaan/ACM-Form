# ACM Form - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing ACM Email Field in Form
**Problem:** The form was trying to collect `acm_email` field but it wasn't present in the HTML form.

**Solution:** Added the ACM Email input field to `templates/index.html` after the regular Email field.

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/index.html` (lines 259-262)

---

### 2. ✅ Gap in Google Sheet After Email Column
**Problem:** The `acm_email` field was being collected but might cause data alignment issues in the sheet.

**Solution:** Verified and maintained proper column order in the data array. The order is now:
1. Timestamp
2. Member ID
3. Name
4. Email
5. ACM Email
6. Roll
7. SAP
8. Phone
9. Year
10. Course
11. Branch

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` (data structure verified and maintained)

---

### 3. ✅ Confirmation Page Not Showing
**Problem:** Success page wasn't showing after form submission, likely due to errors blocking the flow.

**Solution:** 
- Added explicit `return redirect(url_for("index"))` statements for all error paths
- Wrapped email sending in a try-except block so email failures don't prevent the success page from showing
- Improved error handling throughout the submission flow

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` (lines 70-86)

---

### 4. ✅ Email Not Sending
**Problem:** Email sending was failing silently and blocking the success page.

**Solution:**
- Wrapped `generate_and_send_badge()` call in try-except block
- Added detailed logging for email success/failure
- Made email sending non-blocking - form submission succeeds even if email fails
- Added proper error messages to console

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` (lines 70-76)
- `email_code/acm_email.py` (improved error handling)

---

### 5. ✅ Changed Badge Attachment from HTML to PDF
**Problem:** Badge was being sent as HTML file instead of PDF.

**Solution:**
- Added `weasyprint==60.1` to requirements.txt for HTML to PDF conversion
- Created new method `convert_html_to_pdf()` in ACMBadgeGenerator class
- Updated `send_professional_email()` to convert HTML badge to PDF before attaching
- Changed attachment filename from `.html` to `.pdf`
- Updated email body text to mention PDF instead of HTML

**Files Modified:**
- `requirements.txt` (added xhtml2pdf instead of weasyprint for better Render compatibility)
- `email_code/acm_email.py` (lines 13, 84-116, 173-223, 265-266)

**Note:** Initially used weasyprint but switched to xhtml2pdf (pisa) because:
- xhtml2pdf is pure Python with no system dependencies
- Better compatibility with Render's hosting environment
- Faster conversion and no worker timeout issues

---

## Installation & Deployment

### For Local Development:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### For Production (Render):
The changes are compatible with your existing Render deployment. Make sure to:
1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. Render will automatically detect the updated `requirements.txt` and install weasyprint
3. No additional configuration needed

### System Dependencies:
The updated version uses `xhtml2pdf` (pisa) which is a pure Python library and requires no system dependencies. This makes it perfect for Render deployment with no additional configuration needed.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Form Submission:**
   - Fill out the form with all required fields including the new ACM Email field
   - Verify that data is properly saved to Google Sheets
   - Confirm success page displays correctly

2. **Test Email Functionality:**
   - Check that emails are being sent successfully
   - Verify that the PDF badge is attached (not HTML)
   - Confirm the badge PDF opens and displays correctly

3. **Test Error Handling:**
   - Test with invalid credentials to ensure error messages display
   - Test with sheet access issues to ensure graceful degradation

---

## Notes

- Email sending is now non-blocking, so users will see the success page even if email delivery fails
- All email errors are logged to console for debugging
- The PDF conversion maintains the same visual design as the original HTML badge
- ACM Email is now a required field in the registration form
